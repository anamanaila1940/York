The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as
York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its 
kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the 
third-highest office of the Church of England (after the monarch as Supreme 
Governor and the Archbishop of Canterbury), and is the mother church for the 
Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under
 the Dean of York. The title "minster" is attributed to churches established in the 
Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific 
title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or 
Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.

The minster was completed in 1472 after several centuries of building. It is devoted 
to Saint Peter, and has a very wide Decorated Gothic nave and chapter house, a 
Perpendicular Gothic quire and east end and Early English North and South transepts. 
The nave contains the West Window, constructed in 1338, and over the Lady Chapel in 
the east end is the Great East Window (finished in 1408), the largest expanse of 
medieval stained glass in the world. In the north transept is the Five Sisters Window, 
each lancet being over 53 feet (16.3 m) high. The south transept contains a rose window, 
while the West Window contains a heart-shaped design colloquially known as The Heart 
of Yorkshire.
