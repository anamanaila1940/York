York Castle is a fortified complex in the city of York, England. It consists of 
a sequence of castles, prisons, law courts and other buildings, which were built 
over the last nine centuries on the south side of the River Foss. The now-ruined 
keep of the medieval Norman castle is commonly referred to as Clifford's Tower. 
Built originally on the orders of William I to dominate the former Viking city 
of Jórvík, the castle suffered a tumultuous early history before developing into 
a major fortification with extensive water defences. After a major explosion in 
1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, York Castle continued 
to be used as a jail and prison until 1929.

York was a Viking capital in the 10th century, and continued as an important 
northern city in the 11th century. In 1068, on William the Conqueror's first 
northern expedition after the Norman Conquest, he built a number of castles across 
the north-east of England, including one at York. This first castle at York was a 
basic wooden motte and bailey castle built between the rivers Ouse and Foss on the 
site of the present-day York Castle. It was built in haste; contemporary accounts 
imply it was constructed in only eight days, although this assertion has been 
challenged. The motte was originally around 200 feet (61 metres) wide at the base. 
As it was built in an urban environment, hundreds of houses had to be destroyed to 
make way for the development. William Malet, the sheriff of Yorkshire, was placed in 
charge of the castle and successfully defended it against an immediate uprising by 
the local population.
