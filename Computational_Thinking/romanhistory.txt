While archaeological evidence suggests that settlements around York date back to the Mesolithic period, the city as we now know it began with the Romans in 71 AD, when 5000 men from the ninth legion marched from Lincoln
to set up camp and conquer York. Not only did the Romans create York, they lived and ruled in it for the next three centuries, turning it into a city of global importance. 

Only 2% of Roman remains have been rediscovered in York, so some of the Roman city still remains a secret. The longest stretch of surviving Roman Fortress wall is in the Museum Gardens, including the Multangular Tower. 
Although the Roman Empire eventually faded, their legacy lives on. The armies of ancient Rome will march on York again this summer at the Eboracum Roman Festival, the remains of York’s Roman bathhouse can be explored 
on St Sampson’s Square and The Yorkshire Museum is home to some of Britain’s most significant Roman treasures.
