The Multiangular Tower in the Museum Gardens is the most noticeable and intact 
structure remaining from the Roman walls. It was constructed as part of a series
of eight similar defensive towers. The walls are almost certainly the creation 
of Septimius Severus; however, the Multiangular Tower is probably a later 
addition of Constantine the Great around 310â€“320 AD. It has ten sides, based on 
a regular fourteen-sided figure designed so that a circle through the internal 
angles of the internal face is tangential to the curve. The rear four sides are 
missing to provide access to the interior of the tower. A low plinth or skirt 
extends out from the lowest course.

The tower stands almost 30 feet (9.1 m) tall, has an external diameter of 48.5 
feet (14.8 m) at the base and 46 feet (14 m) above the skirt. Length of each side 
varies from 7.5 feet (2.3 m) to 11 feet (3.4 m) on the inner face. The tower 
projects beyond the curtain wall to a distance of 36.75 feet (11.20 m). The 
foundations are concrete, atop which the tower extends having a rubble and mortar 
core between ashlar faced courses of small magnesian limestone blocks. At 15 feet 
(4.6 m) a scarcement reduces the thickness of the wall from 5 feet (1.5 m) to 3.25 
feet (0.99 m), which continues for a further 4 feet (1.2 m) before being capped by 
11 feet (3.4 m) of 13th century masonry in which arrowslits can be seen.
