York railway station was the largest in the world when it opened in 1877. Built by the North

Eastern Railway, the structure included 13 platforms, a train shed, station buildings and a 
hotel.

The track layout of the new station allowed trains to pass directly through York for the 
first time. The previous building, now known as York old railway station, was designed as 
a terminus â€“ trains for London had to reverse out of the station to continue their journey.

York station was designed by Thomas Elliot Harrison, a former president of ICE.

Two additional platforms were added in 1909. Other later works included repairs after 
extensive bombing in World War 2 and changes to track layout in 1988 as part of 
preparations for electrification of the line.

York remains a key junction today. It's approximately halfway between London and 
Edinburgh. The station is about 5 miles north of routes connecting Scotland to the 
Midlands and southern England.

York station became a Grade 2 listed building in 1968.
