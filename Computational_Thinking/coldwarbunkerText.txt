The York Cold War Bunker is a two-storey, semi-subterranean, Cold War bunker in the
Holgate area of York, England, built in 1961 to monitor nuclear explosions and
fallout in Yorkshire, in the event of nuclear war.

One of about 30 around the United Kingdom, the building was used throughout its
operational existence as the regional headquarters and control centre for the
Royal Observer Corps's No. 20 Group YORK between 1961 and 1991. It has become an
English Heritage Scheduled Monument and was opened in 2006 by English Heritage
as a tourist attraction.

During its Cold War operational period, the building could have supported 60 local
volunteer members of the Royal Observer Corps, inclusive of a ten-man United
Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation scientific warning team. They would 
have collated details of nuclear bombs exploded within the UK and tracked 
radioactive fallout across the Yorkshire region, warning the public of its approach. 
This example of an ROC control building is the only one that is preserved in its 
operational condition. The others stand derelict or have either been demolished or 
sold. A few have been converted to other uses, like No. 16 Group Shrewsbury that is 
now a veterinary clinic, another is a recording studio, two are satellite and 
communications control centres, and one is a solicitor's file storage facility.

The fully restored building contains air filtration and generating plant, kitchen 
and canteen, dormitories, radio and landline communication equipment and specialist 
1980s computers and a fully equipped operations room with vertical illuminated 
perspex maps.
