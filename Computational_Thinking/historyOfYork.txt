"The History of York is the history of England." King George VI

York is one of England’s finest and most beautiful historic cities. The Romans knew it as Eboracum. To the Saxons it was Eoforwick. The Vikings, who came as invaders but stayed on in settlements, called it Jorvik. York’s more recent history has also characterised the city. There’s the iconic York Minster and architecture from medieval times, its magnificent Georgian town houses and its Victorian railway station.

As you explore York you will discover that every aspect of York’s modern life is inextricably linked with its past. Within its ancient, encircling walls, York’s medieval streets and buildings are beautifully preserved in the historic heart of the city. Shambles is a must-visit, as one of the most recognised historic streets in England, often referred to as the best-preserved medieval street in Europe.
