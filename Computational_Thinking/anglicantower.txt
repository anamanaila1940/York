There are no comparable secular buildings of this date in Europe, so there really isn't 
anything to compare the Anglian Tower to. That means that estimates of when it was built 
are educated guesses at best.

The tower might date to the very end of the Roman period in the early 5th century AD, or 
to the early Anglo-Saxon period. It has traditionally been associated with King Edwin of 
Deira (586-633), who rebuilt the defences of York in the early 7th century. 
King Edwin was  baptised at what is now York Minster in AD 627.

Around AD 900 the Roman walls were backfilled to create ramparts and the tower was 
lost beneath rubble for over 900 years. It was rediscovered in 1839 by workmen digging 
a tunnel between Mint Yard and St Leonard's Place. It was not fully excavated until 1971. 
Sadly, the man leading the excavation, Jeffrey Radly, died on-site during the dig.

The Anglian Tower originally stood two storeys high but only one storey remains. The 
Anglo-Saxon walls may stand atop an earlier Roman foundation. The tower is built of 
roughly dressed oolitic limestone blocks with a brick-vaulted roof. It stands about 4.5m 
high (roughly 15 feet) and may be between two mural towers on the south-western side of 
the Roman fortress.

We don't know exactly when the tower was built, but the next question is why was it built?

There are two ground-level opposed doorways allowing a sentry to walk directly through 
the tower, but the chamber within the tower appears to have no other function than to 
allow an unobstructed passage.
