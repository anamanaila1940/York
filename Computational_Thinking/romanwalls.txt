The original walls were built around 71 AD, when the Romans erected a fort (castra)
occupying about 50 acres or 21.5 hectares near the banks of the River Ouse. The 
rectangle of walls was built as part of the fort's defences. The foundations and 
the line of about half of these Roman walls form part of the existing walls, as follows:

-a section (the west corner, including the Multangular Tower) in the Museum Gardens

-the north-west and north-east sections between Bootham Bar and Monk Bar

-a further stretch between Monk Bar and the Merchant Taylors' Hall, at the end of 
which the lower courses of the east corner of the Roman wall can be seen on the 
city-centre side of the existing wall.

The line of the rest of the Roman wall went south-west from the east corner, 
crossing the via principalis of the fortress where King's Square is now located. 
The south corner was in what is now Feasegate, and from here the wall continued 
northwest to the west corner. The point where the wall crossed the via praetoria 
is marked by a plaque in St Helen's Square near the Mansion House.
