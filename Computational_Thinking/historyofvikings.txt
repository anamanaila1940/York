The Viking invasion of York took place on November 1st 866AD and was led by Ivar The Boneless who along with King Halfden renamed the city Jorvik.

The Vikings who settled in York were mainly a peaceful bunch despite what we read about their bloody campaigns. 
They farmed the land and were great craftsmen, traders, artists, engineers and ship builders. Over the one hundred years that York was under Viking rule the city rospered greatly. 
Today the Viking heritage is still celebrated in the city, through the Scandinavian name for a road, ‘Gata’, which appears in street namessuch as Stonegate and Petergate to the world-famous JORVIK Viking Centre which 
takes visitors on an unforgettable journey back in time to relive everyday Viking life. It’s even evident through The Little Vikings who offer recommendations for families in the city. 
We can certainly thank the Vikings in part for the beautiful legacy they have left in the city.
