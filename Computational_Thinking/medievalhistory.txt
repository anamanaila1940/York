The Medieval period is an important era in York’s history, as many of the city’s landmark buildings that make up the city skyline were built within this era. 

The city walls were rebuilt and strengthened, and old wooden Viking buildings were reconstructed in stone. Four new fortified gates, or "bars", were built to regulate traffic through the walls and the stone keep of York 
Castle (today known as Clifford’s Tower) was reinforced. The city’s growing prosperity in trade and commerce is reflected in the imposing Merchant Adventurers' Hall and the Guildhall. 

Learn more about the medieval history of the city at the Yorkshire Museum’s display showcasing their permanent collection of the region’s greatest surviving treasures. The exhibition ‘Medieval York: Capital of the 
North’ explores how York became England’s second city and how its fortunes rose and fell with its ties to the Crown and the Church.
