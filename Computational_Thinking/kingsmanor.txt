King's Manor was originally built to house the abbots of St Mary's Abbey, York. The 
Abbot's house probably occupied the site since the eleventh century, but the earliest 
remains date from the fifteenth century. When the abbey was dissolved in 1539, Henry 
VIII instructed that it be the seat of the Council of the North. It performed this 
role until the Council was abolished in 1641. From 1667 to 1688, it was the residence 
of the Governor of York. During the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Governor, Sir 
John Reresby, 2nd Baronet, remained loyal to the King, James II, but a party of armed 
men, led by Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, captured the Manor and the City of York, 
and held them for William of Orange. After 1688, the building was hired out to private 
tenants until the nineteenth century, when it was taken over and expanded by the 
Yorkshire School for the Blind.

For a detailed description of the history and architecture of the building, perhaps 
the best source is that contained in the RCHME Inventory of the City of York, Volume 
IV. The buildings were upgraded and embellished by Thomas Wentworth, Lord President 
of the Council of the North from 1628 to 1631, with new door ways and coats of arms.
