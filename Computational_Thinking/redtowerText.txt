Before his defeat in 1485, Richard III agreed spending with the city corporation to repair 
and improve the walls. Negotiations continued with his successor, Henry VII, who visited 
York a number of times to impose his authority and ensure the loyalty of the city.
The Mayor, William Todd paid for 60yds of wall repairs near Fishergate Bar in 1485 (see 
the plaque this on the Bar) and was knighted by Henry VII in 1487, after the city repelled 
a rebel attack on Bootham Bar.
Unrest continued, and in 1489 a further rebellion severely damaged both Walmgate and 
Fishergate Bars, after which Fishergate was walled up.
In 1491, the king was still ordering repairs and improvements to the city walls, 
bars and defensive ditches, and for guns and powder to be obtained. Similar instructions 
were issued by the Mayor to every Ward in the city in 1493.
These works must have included Red Tower, as it was under construction in 1490. 
Fishergate Postern Tower was started in 1503. Red Tower is the only brick tower in 
the city, hence its name. The lower levels of the Tower appear to be masonry, so either 
the brickwork was built on an earlier masonry structure, or stone was used for the part 
which was under the waters of the Kingâ€™s Fishpond.
The top of the Tower was originally similar to Monk Bar, with a flat lead roof and 
battlements, as did Fishergate Postern Tower.
The Tower was first mentioned by name in 1511, when artillery was assigned to it. After 
repair in 1541 and 1545, it was regularly leased.
